## Yearly Progress

The following totals includes the LC I've practiced so far. I do not include repeated LCs.

## Goal
My goal is to improve my ability to think like a software developer, so that way I can break down complex problems into easier to digest parts, and thus come up with solutions, and be able to explain the brute force to more optimal solutions.

I started grinding since 2020 but each year I've come up with better ways to improve my learning. I do a lot of studying of solutions, watching video breakdowns, going back to the basic ideas of approaches, and so on. I really enjoy learning, and I find these skills transferable to my other learnings, such as when I study languages. 

Hopefully some of the content here will help others who happen upon it. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danafng/). I enjoy providing accessible ways for people to learn, and try to make difficult concepts that were once were daunting to me become more simpler to comprehend.
