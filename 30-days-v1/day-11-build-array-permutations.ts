/**
 * Thoughts?
 * 
 * First I'm a bit confused by what's it asking
 * What is a permutation?
 * 
 * def: technique that determines the number of 
 * possible arrangements in a set when the 
 * order of the arrangements matters
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
 * Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]
