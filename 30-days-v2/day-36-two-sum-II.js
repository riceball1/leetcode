/**
 * Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing 
 * order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 * 
 * Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, 
 * where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.
 * 
 * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
